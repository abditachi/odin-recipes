    <h2>discription</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically
      reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such
      as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth
      it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.

    <h2>ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil,</li>
      <li>divided 4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
      <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil
        until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper
        towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic,
        and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add
        tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook,
        stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and
        cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to
        a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes
        too dry and starts to stick to the pan.
      </li>
    </ol>
